## Overview of Foreclosure in Washington

Foreclosure is the legal process a lender uses to recover the balance owed on a mortgage when a homeowner fails to make payments. 
In Washington, the process is typically **non-judicial**, but judicial foreclosures are also allowed.

- **Non-Judicial Foreclosure:** Most common in Washington; involves a trustee sale without court involvement.
- **Judicial Foreclosure:** Requires court proceedings and is used in limited cases, such as when a deficiency judgment is sought.

## Types of Foreclosures in Washington

1. **Non-Judicial Foreclosure:**
   - Washington primarily uses a non-judicial foreclosure process. 
This means the lender does not need to go to court unless it's a judicial foreclosure.
   - No court involvement; faster process.
   - The property is sold at a public auction.

2. **Judicial Foreclosure:**
   - Initiated through the court system.
   - Typically used for mortgages or when the lender seeks a deficiency judgment.
   - Slower but may provide additional opportunities for the homeowner to contest 
the foreclosure.

## Steps in the Foreclosure Process

### 1. **Missed Payments**
   - Foreclosure begins after the homeowner misses payments, usually three or more months.
   - The lender sends a **Breach letter** (typically after 90 days) and may offer alternatives to foreclosure.

### 2. **Notice of Default**
   - If payments remain unpaid, the lender files a NOD with the county recorder.
   - The homeowner receives a copy of the NOD, which includes:
     - Amount owed.
     - Cure period (time to catch up on payments).
     - Contact information for assistance. 
       - Referral to foreclosure mediation (if eligible)

### 3. **Notice of Trustee Sale**
   - Minimum 120 days after Default notice, the lender issues a **Notice of Sale**, 
announcing the date, time, and location of the foreclosure auction.
   - The notice is published in local newspapers and mailed to the homeowner.

### 4. **Foreclosure Sale**
   - The property is auctioned to the highest bidder, often the lender.
   - The sale is final, and the homeowner may lose all rights to the property.

### 5. **Post-Foreclosure**
   - If the home is sold at auction:
     - The new owner (often the lender) can begin eviction proceedings.
   - In a judicial foreclosure, the lender may seek a deficiency judgment 
for the remaining balance after the sale.

3. **Apply for Mediation:**

4. **Explore State and Federal Assistance Programs:**
   - Newer programs like the historical Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF) can provide financial help.
