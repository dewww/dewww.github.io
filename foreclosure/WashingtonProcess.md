## Overview of Foreclosure in Oregon

Foreclosure is the legal process a lender uses to recover the balance owed on a mortgage when a homeowner fails to make payments. In Oregon, the process is typically **non-judicial**, but judicial foreclosures are also allowed.

- **Non-Judicial Foreclosure:** Most common in Oregon; involves a trustee sale without court involvement.
- **Judicial Foreclosure:** Requires court proceedings and is used in limited cases, such as when a deficiency judgment is sought.

## Types of Foreclosures in Oregon

1. **Non-Judicial Foreclosure (Primary Method):**
   - Governed by Oregon's Trust Deed Act.
   - No court involvement; faster process.
   - The property is sold at a public auction.

2. **Judicial Foreclosure:**
   - Initiated through the court system.
   - Typically used for mortgages or when the lender seeks a deficiency judgment.
   - Slower but may provide additional opportunities for the homeowner to contest the foreclosure.

## Steps in the Foreclosure Process

### 1. **Missed Payments**
   - Foreclosure begins after the homeowner misses payments, usually three or more months.
   - The lender sends a **Notice of Default (NOD)** and may offer alternatives to foreclosure.

### 2. **Notice of Default**
   - If payments remain unpaid, the lender files a NOD with the county recorder.
   - The homeowner receives a copy of the NOD, which includes:
     - Amount owed.
     - Cure period (time to catch up on payments).
     - Contact information for assistance.

### 3. **Notice of Sale**
   - After the cure period, the lender issues a **Notice of Sale**, announcing the date, time, and location of the foreclosure auction.
   - The notice is published in local newspapers and mailed to the homeowner.

### 4. **Foreclosure Sale**
   - The property is auctioned to the highest bidder, often the lender.
   - The sale is final, and the homeowner may lose all rights to the property.

### 5. **Post-Foreclosure**
   - If the home is sold at auction:
     - The new owner (often the lender) can begin eviction proceedings.
   - In a judicial foreclosure, the lender may seek a deficiency judgment for the remaining balance after the sale.
